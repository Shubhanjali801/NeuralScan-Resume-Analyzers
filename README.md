| ------------------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Frontend**                    | **React**           | A popular open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces using reusable components and a virtual DOM, enabling efficient, dynamic single-page and native apps.       |
| **Frontend**                    | **React Router v7** | The go-to routing library for React apps, offering nested routes, data loaders/actions, error boundaries, code splitting, and SSR support—all with a smooth upgrade path from v6. |
| **Frontend**                    | **Tailwind CSS**    | A utility-first CSS framework that allows developers to design custom UIs by applying low-level utility classes directly in HTML, streamlining the design process.                |
| **Frontend**                    | **TypeScript**      | A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing, improving tooling, code quality, and error detection—ideal for building large-scale applications.                               |
| **Frontend**                    | **Vite**            | A fast build tool and dev server using native ES modules for instant startup, hot-module replacement, and Rollup-powered production builds.                                       |
| **Frontend / State Management** | **Zustand**         | A minimal, hook-based state management library for React that manages global state with zero boilerplate and excellent performance.                                               |
| **Backend / Cloud Platform**    | **Puter.com**       | An advanced, open-source internet OS designed to be feature-rich, fast, and extensible; used as a privacy-first personal cloud for files, apps, and games.                        |
| **Backend / SDK**               | **Puter.js**        | A tiny client-side SDK that adds serverless auth, storage, database, and AI (GPT, Claude, DALL·E, OCR, etc.) into your browser app—no backend needed.                             |
| **Other Tools**                 | **—**               | These tools collectively enable building modern, efficient, and scalable full-stack applications with ease of deployment and high performance.                                    |
